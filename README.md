ScriptLibrary
=============

A random collection of unrelated scripts I have thrown together over 10 years of messing around with Powershell.

tl;dr Use at your own risk.

I don't make any promsies that any of these scripts work as expected. They are the result of hacking sessions to understand how feature of Powershell or 3rd party components work.

You might find some of one of these snippets a useful starting point for some problem you have, but the code most likely does not conform with best practices and was probably not performance tested.
